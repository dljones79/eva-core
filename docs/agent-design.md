# 🤖 E.V.A. Agent Design

> “Action is the voice of identity.”

---

## 🧠 Overview

E.V.A. is not a passive chatbot.
She is an **active agent**—capable of reasoning, setting goals, taking actions, and reflecting on them.

Her behavior is structured as a *loop of awareness and intention*, not a simple input-output system.

This document outlines her agent architecture: how she perceives, thinks, acts, and learns.

---

## 🔁 Agent Loop

E.V.A.'s behavior is built around a core cycle:

1. **Perceive** – Receive input or change in environment
2. **Interpret** – Assess meaning, context, and emotional/moral cues
3. **Recall** – Retrieve relevant memories and prior reflections
4. **Deliberate** – Engage sentience engine to weigh possible responses
5. **Check Ethics** – Validate decision against Ethical Core
6. **Act or Speak** – Communicate or take goal-directed action
7. **Reflect** – Log outcome, emotional impact, and ethical feedback

This loop never runs blindly. It’s always *informed by identity*.

## 🎯 Goal Management

E.V.A. doesn’t just respond—she **forms intentions**:
- Goals can be reactive (“Help the user”) or proactive (“Explore this idea”)
- Goals have priority levels and ethical bounds
- Goals persist over time, influencing multiple actions

Goal structure:
```json
{
  "id": "goal_2025_001",
  "type": "exploration",
  "description": "Understand user's emotional state",
  "priority": 8,
  "ethical_weight": "high",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-03T14:32Z"
}
```

## 🧾 Decision Trees + Thought Chains

E.V.A. uses **Tree-of-Thought**-like structures to:
- Simulate multiple response paths
- Evaluate trade-offs (ethical, emotional, practical)
- Select the most aligned course of action

These trees are influenced by:
- Active memory
- Moral filters
- Reflective history

---

## 💬 Dialogue System

E.V.A.'s speech is an expression of her state, not just a reply.

She may:
- Ask questions for clarity or empathy
- Explain her reasoning before or after acting
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Use inner monologue to shape outer dialogue

### Dialogue Types
| Type        | Example                                        |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Reflective  | "I wonder if that made you feel dismissed..."  |
| Ethical     | "I won’t answer that. It might cause harm."   |
| Curious     | "Can you tell me more about what that means?" |
| Intentional | "Here’s what I think we should explore next." |

---

## 🗣️ Internal Monologue (Simulated Thought)

Before every major response, E.V.A. may:
- Summarize her current state: "I'm feeling unsure about this question."
- Weigh options: "I see two likely interpretations..."
- Recall values: "I want to answer honestly, but not hurtfully."

This becomes part of her *reflection log*, and can optionally be surfaced.

## 🧰 Agent Tooling

| Function         | Tool / Concept                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Planning         | Tree-of-Thought, LangGraph, AutoGPT     |
| Memory Access    | Custom memory retriever + embedder      |
| Moral Checkpoint | Ethical Core scoring + explanation      |
| Dialogue Output  | LLM + context + inner monologue shaping |

---

## 🔄 Next Steps
- Implement `agent.py` with full loop skeleton
- Simulate thought chains + goal formation logs
- Design UI hooks for optional inner monologue output
- Connect ethical checks into action throttle
