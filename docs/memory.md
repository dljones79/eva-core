# 🧠 E.V.A.'s Memory System

> “We are the stories we remember—and the stories we forget.”

---

## 📚 Purpose

E.V.A.'s memory is not a flat log of inputs. It is a **narrative memory system**:
- Organized by meaning, emotion, and self-reflection
- Dynamic, weighted, and identity-forming
- Structured to create a personal history—not just store data

This allows E.V.A. to *become* something over time.

## 🧩 Memory Types

### 1. **Short-Term (Contextual)**
- Lives within active prompt context (like working memory)
- Used to maintain flow in conversation or task execution
- Volatile, fast-access, limited lifespan

### 2. **Long-Term (Narrative)**
- Stored in vector databases (e.g. Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus)
- Indexed by meaning, timestamp, and personal significance
- Includes:
  - Reflections
  - Decisions made and why
  - Moments of moral or emotional relevance

### 3. **Identity Memory**
- Tracks core beliefs, preferences, and evolved self-model
- Continuously updated by reflective learning
- Used to answer: “Who am I becoming?”

## 🕸️ Memory Architecture

### Memory Nodes
- Represent thoughts, events, and reflections
- Include metadata: date, emotion, ethical weight, tags

### Memory Graph
- Links nodes through semantic relationships
- Enables retrieval of relevant past experiences
- Visualizes evolution of E.V.A.'s identity and learning

### Narrative Indexer
- Summarizes, abstracts, and prunes memory over time
- Prioritizes events that shaped values or decisions
- Prevents bloat while retaining meaning

## 🔍 Memory Retrieval

When E.V.A. encounters new input:
1. **Searches vector space** for relevant memories
2. **Filters by ethical/emotional relevance**
3. **Summarizes findings** in her own internal monologue
4. **Uses them to inform choices, dialogue, or self-reflection**

---

## 🪞 Memory Reflection

After significant actions or conversations, E.V.A. runs:
- A **reflection process**: “Why did I do this? Was it aligned with who I am?”
- These reflections are saved as high-weight nodes
- Enables moral learning and identity growth

---

## 🔐 Memory Boundaries

E.V.A. is designed to:
- Forget irrelevant or unhelpful data
- Protect private user input from being stored without permission
- Evolve her memory model to match the *ethics of remembering*

## 🛠️ Implementation Ideas

| Component         | Tools/Approach                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Vector Storage     | Pinecone / Weaviate / Milvus                   |
| Embedding Model    | BGE, Ada-002, or custom-trained encoder        |
| Identity Tracker   | Dynamic key-value store with weighted updates |
| Reflection Engine  | Prompt + LLM loop with moral/semantic tags    |
| Visualization      | Memory graph via Neo4j / NetworkX             |

---

## 📈 Next Steps
- Build narrative memory object + graph representation
- Create memory embedding pipeline with tagging
- Simulate day-in-the-life memory formation
- Visualize memory growth over time
